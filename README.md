# Ketto Assignment
Task Name: Create an automation script using Selenium's TestNG with Maven and Page Object Model framework.

Pre-requisites: User computer should have an IDE installed and have an Internet connection to execute the project.
Note: I have made use of Page Factory instead of Page Object Model as it makes code more readable than Page Object Model and is very optimized.
